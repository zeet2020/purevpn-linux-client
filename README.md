Electron application to create pptp vpn network and use your purevpn credential to connect to 
various host across coutry. this client is specifically build to work on linux, because its use linux command to update vpn host name and connect to vpn using network cmd, and nm-cli. 

purevpn has gui client to connect to vpn network in windows and mac but there no easy to use gui client on linux. this electron application solve problem for me as am linux users and purevpn premium member
